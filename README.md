# object_models

Textured object meshes used for pose estimation, collision checking, and visualization.

## Repository Structure

This repository contains two subfolders:

1. `cnos_templates` - Contains images of each object to be used by the [CNOS](https://github.com/nv-nguyen/cnos) method for object segmentation.
2. `obj_meshes` - Contains `.obj` mesh files defining each object's geometry, with additional files defining its visual properties.

Inside these folders, subfolders are named based on the object they represent (e.g., an Expo spray called `expo_spray`).
